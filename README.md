# Hype
Hype is a agile methodology created for

* small remote teams
* with irregular time investement
* working in software development
* without cashflow


## Intro

[The list of agile methodologies is long](http://noop.nl/2008/07/the-definitive-list-of-software-development-methodologies.html). Because common methodologies are created by people working in or for companies, they all assume that time is a given constant. 

Problems occure when you work together with other people on side projects. Time is not a given constant. 
That's why the hype framework doesn't focus on providing maximum value in a give set of time.

Hype focuses on providing maximum motivation when investing irregular time.



## Principles

### Transparency

The hype framework guides for maximal transparency. On one hand that means it's embraced to communicate which feelings you have towards something. Especially if it is fear, anger or a concern. On the other hand you should be able to have a link to anything.

A written down idea, a sketch, a proof of concept. Make sure everything you talk about is reachable as long as it's important.

### Decentralization

This might sound strange but with irregular time investment it is even more important to never make yourself a dependency. This means: Everything that is needed should be available de-centralized. Every member of the team should be able **to throw their laptop away** at any point in the project.

### Wabi-sabi

This is a little pathetic. Wabi Sabi is japanese and stands for acceptenace for imperfection. In shadow, it is advised to eliminate every doubt, concern, quality aspect you have towards something. Everything is finished even with the smallest improvement. 

### Patience

When working irregulary on projects with other, you don't know how the team members priotise their time or ressources. Therefore it is crucial to come with a basic patience and give everyone the time to act. 



## Phases

### Planning

Planning is the time spent on What should be achieved and how.

### Implementation

Implementation is the time spent on actually transferring a plan into something valuable.
