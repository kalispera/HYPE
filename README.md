Shadow is a agile process framework for small remote teams with irregular time investement


## Who is shadow for?

The purpose of Shadow is to help small teams working irregulary on projects.

## Principles

### Trust

If you work remotely with others. You need trust. Like a lot.
You need to put the trust in them that what they will put into the project is what they think is appropiate. Content and Ideas should be always discussable but trust should be a given fundament everything else builds upon.

### Transparency

The shadow framework guides for maximal transparency. On one hand that means it's embraced to communicate which feelings you have towards something. Especially if it is fear, anger or a concern. On the other hand you should be able to have a link to anything.

A written down idea, a sketch, a proof of concept. Make sure everything you talk about is reachable as long as it's important.

### Decentralization

This might sound strange but with irregular time investment it is even more important to never make yourself a dependency. This means: Everything that is needed should be available de-centralized. Every member of the team should be able **to throw their laptop away** at any point in the project.

### Wabi-sabi

This is a little pathetic. Wabi Sabi is japanese and stands for acceptenace for imperfection. In shadow, it is advised to eliminate every doubt, concern, quality aspect you have towards something. Everything is finished even with the smallest improvement. 

### Patience

When working irregulary on projects with other, you don't know how the team members priotise their time or ressources. Therefore it is crucial to come with a basic patience and give everyone the time to act.
