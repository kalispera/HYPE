# Hype
Hype is a agile project management framework created for

* small teams
* with irregular time investement
* on projects without financial obligations and/or deadlines

## Intro

The name Hype refers to the state of mind where you are so motivated to put an idea into reality, you're filled with joy when you only think about starting.

[Established](http://noop.nl/2008/07/the-definitive-list-of-software-development-methodologies.html) methodologies and/or frameworks assume time is a given constant. On side projects, available time isn't a constant. It's a variable that is different for every team member and is influenced by the motivation you have to work on the project.

**That's why hype focuses on providing maximum motivation when investing irregular time.**

## Principles

### Transparency

The hype framework guides for maximal transparency. On one hand that means it's embraced to communicate which feelings you have towards something. Especially if it is fear, anger or a concern. On the other hand you should be able to have a link to anything.

A written down idea, a sketch, a proof of concept. Make sure everything you talk about is reachable as long as it's important.

### Decentralization

This might sound strange but with irregular time investment it is even more important to never make yourself a dependency. This means: Everything that is needed should be available de-centralized. Every member of the team should be able **to throw their laptop away** at any point in the project.

### Wabi-sabi

Wabi Sabi is japanese and stands for acceptenace for imperfection. In hype, it is advised to eliminate every doubt, concern, quality aspect you have towards something. Everything is finished even with the smallest improvement.

### Chaos

Because hype embraces that humans are individuals and make mistakes, it leaves room for chaos. Not everything can and not everything should be controlled. 

### Patience

When working irregulary on projects with other, you don't know how the team members priotise their time or ressources. Therefore it is crucial to come with a basic patience and give everyone the time to act.



## Hype Events

### Sync

Sync is the only event where synchronous communication is needed.

A sync can be a walk together in the park, a meeting or a video call. Or anything else where a focuses conversation can happen.

First step of the sync: define the contents of the sync. 

In general you should decide on you own what it is you want to talk about. Possible questionst to be answered could be:

 * Have there been moments or situations where you've experienced demotivation?
 * Are you blocked by a task from someone else?
 * Are we still working towards the vision?
 * Does everyone knows what to do next?
 * Do you need help?

### Delivery

Deliver happens invididually and each team member can decide on their own when and how to work on their tasks.
When a tasks has been "delivered" it should be asynchronously communicated with the team.

## Hype Artifacts


### Idea Board

The Idea board is your place to store ideas and make them visible to your team. 
It is not a backlog and not a prioritised list of tasks to be achieved.
